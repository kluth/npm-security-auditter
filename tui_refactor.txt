It seems you're denying the write permission each time. I can't proceed without being able to create files. Could you please either:

1. **Accept the permission** when the prompt appears (it should say something like "Allow Claude to write to internal/tui/styles.go?")
2. Or tell me if you'd prefer a different approach (e.g., me outputting the code as text for you to copy)

Without write access to the `internal/tui/` directory, I cannot create the new TUI files.
